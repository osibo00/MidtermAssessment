# MidtermAssessment
I was able to complete all the steps, but I was not able to make it all work the way I wanted. I ran out of time.
So I would say its not finished really

I understood how to implement everything except for async task.
I believe I got the async task working, but I could not get it to run onPostExecute so I couldnt get my intent to work.
I havent really practiced much with async tasks. I have it set it to where it skips the async executor on LoopActivity because 
I couldnt get the intent to work.
